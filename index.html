          <h3 class="text-center">Reborn Doll Artist</h3>
          <hr>
          <div class="well">
            <p class="text-justify">Lisa Sylvia was introduced to the world of reborning (the painting of vinyl or silicone dolls so that they appear as lifelike as possible) in early 2011. Ever keen to improve upon her work in making vinyl newborn dolls look as lifelike as possible, she worked through as many tutorials as she could find to expose herself to as many methods as possible, before developing her own unique style. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">Her gallery of work features a range of reborn dolls: whether "asleep", "awake", with mono-rooted, or painted hair, whether you find them unsettling or adorable, the realism of her work is undeniable and sure to impress.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">During her reborning journey, Lisa discovered her passion for color theory, as well as a desire to help other artists. In addition to offering other aspiring artists advice and tips, she also co-founded/moderated Facebook groups dedicated to help other artists succeed.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">Although she took a hiatus from reborning after the birth of her third child, she came back to the reborn world and quickly realised that with a baby in the house, monorooting hair was an almost impossible task while juggling the needs of her infant daughter. She found painting hair to be a much more infant-friendly task and focused her efforts into creating painted hair that displayed the same depth and realism as rooted hair had to offer.

          <h3 class="text-center">Entrepreneurial Spirit</h3>
          <hr>
          <div class="well">
            <p class="text-justify">As Lisa's contact with other reborn doll artists grew, she became aware of the concern that many artists shared over the health implications of heating the vinyl doll parts which required multiple baking sessions per doll in order to cure the layers of heat-set paints.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">Lisa teamed up with another reborn-doll artist to develop Miracle Blend air-dry paints. The paints worked well and quickly found a fan-base with artists wanting the realism they could achieve with heat-set paints but without the health issues.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">Lisa's drive to further develop the brand led her to discuss with her Miracle Blend partner, the idea of floating her own select line of paints in which she would have autonomous control in sourcing and product development. They decided to split the partnership and Lisa left to concentrate on her own premium paints.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-justify">Lisa took her deepened knowledge of color theory along with the feedback and suggestions garnered from her Miracle Blend fanbase and researched the ingredients to create an even higher-pigmented, more durable air dry paint that easily adhered to vinyl and was robust enough not to require a primer or a sealer. Thus Ultimate Fusion air dry paints were born.
